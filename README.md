# Movie-Recommendation-System
These Methods presents collaborative  filtering   methods   and   content-based   filtering method   that   can   recommend   a   item   to   a   user   with   good accuracy.  The  proposed  methods  linear  regression,  SingularValue  Decomposition  (SVD),  baseline  prediction  and  vectorspace model are very basic and efficient methods to recommend items  to  a  user.  In  this  Project,  the  datasets  we  are  using  are Netflix  Prize  dataset  and  MovieLens dataset. To check the accuracy of the methods  we  are  using  root  mean  square  error  (RMSE)  value. SVD method and vector space model proves to best among the proposed  methods  for  recommendation.
